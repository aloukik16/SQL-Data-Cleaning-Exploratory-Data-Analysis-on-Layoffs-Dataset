<p id="description">üìå Description This project focuses on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL on a layoffs dataset. The dataset contains records of company layoffs across various industries providing insights into workforce reductions over time. 
  *<h3>üîç Key Objectives: </h3>
      * ‚úî Data Cleaning: Handling missing values standardizing formats and removing inconsistencies using SQL queries. 
      * ‚úî Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing trends identifying patterns and extracting key insights from the layoffs dataset. 
      * ‚úî SQL Query Optimization: Efficiently processing and querying large datasets for better analysis. This project demonstrates the power of SQL in data wrangling and analysis making it easier to derive                 meaningful business insights.</p>
