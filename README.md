## 📌 Description  

This project focuses on **data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using **SQL** on a layoffs dataset. The dataset contains records of company layoffs across various industries, providing insights into workforce reductions over time.  

### 🔍 Key Objectives:  
✔ **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, standardizing formats, and removing inconsistencies using SQL queries.  
✔ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing trends, identifying patterns, and extracting key insights from the layoffs dataset.  
✔ **SQL Query Optimization:** Efficiently processing and querying large datasets for better analysis.  

This project demonstrates the power of **SQL in data wrangling and analysis**, making it easier to derive meaningful business insights. 🚀
